# swiftui-designs


This repository contains a collection of small, non-functional iOS apps built with **SwiftUI**. Each project focuses on experimenting with different UI designs, SwiftUI features and layout techniques.

The goal isn't to create complete apps, but to explore and get hands-on experience with SwiftUI â€” from visual styles to component structure, animation, and responsiveness.
